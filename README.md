# C++ Point-and-Click Game (ARCHIVE)

A short point-and-click adventure game, featuring multiple rooms with dynamic object loading, a pick-up system, smart pointers, and numerous different prop objects to interact with. 

Made in ~2 months for a university assignment submission, as part of the "Games in C++' module at UWE Bristol (BSc Games Technology).
